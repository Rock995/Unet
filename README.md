# UNet: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation. It was first introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in their 2015 paper [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).

The architecture is characterized by its U-shape, which allows it to capture both the context and the localization needed for accurate segmentation. The network consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.

## Features

- **High Accuracy:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various biomedical image segmentation tasks.
- **End-to-End Training:** Trains on images and their corresponding segmentation masks.
- **Versatile:** Can be applied to different types of biomedical images, including MRI, CT, and microscopy images.

## Architecture

The UNet architecture consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which gives it the characteristic U-shape.

1. **Contracting Path:** Consists of repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU and a 2x2 max pooling operation for downsampling. At each downsampling step, the number of feature channels is doubled.
2. **Bottleneck:** Consists of two 3x3 convolutions followed by a ReLU.
3. **Expansive Path:** Each step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution ("up-convolution") that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions followed by a ReLU.
